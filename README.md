This repository contains a simple **Book Management System** application built using Python's Tkinter library. The application is designed to help manage a small library or book collection by allowing users to add, update, delete, and search for books in a database. Additionally, the repository includes a utility script for handling application closure in a user-friendly way.

## Introduction

The **Book Management System** is a GUI-based application that facilitates the management of a book database. The system allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of books. It uses SQLite as the backend database to store book information and Tkinter for the graphical user interface.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to provide a simple and easy-to-use tool for managing books. This tool can be particularly useful for small libraries, educational institutions, or individuals looking to organize their personal book collections.

## Features

- **Add New Books**: Enter details such as book name, author name, ISBN number, volume, availability status, and more.
- **Update Book Information**: Modify existing book records to keep the database up-to-date.
- **Delete Books**: Remove books from the database when they are no longer needed.
- **Search Books**: Quickly find books by their name or other attributes.
- **View All Books**: Display a list of all books stored in the database.
- **Graceful Application Closure**: The application prompts the user before closing, ensuring no accidental data loss.

## Implementation

The project is implemented using the following technologies and concepts:

- **Tkinter**: Used to create the graphical user interface for the application.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight database used for storing book information.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes and methods are used to structure the application.
- **Exception Handling**: Proper handling of potential errors, such as empty form fields or database connection issues.
- **Responsive UI**: The application layout adjusts to different screen sizes, making it user-friendly.
